Next, fold in the all-purpose flour and almond flour, and gently mix everything into a nice dough. Place this between two sheets of baking paper and flatten slightly, before resting the dough in the refrigerator for 1 hour. Grease 8 rings with extra butter and place them on a tray lined with baking paper. If you don't have 8 rings you can bake these in batches. Place a disc inside each greased ring and press gently, starting from the bottom and working your way up the sides. If the edges are above the rim, carefully trim them with a small knife, then pop these in the refrigerator for 1 hour.

Then pour out the starch water and add in fresh salt water, repeating the process a total of 3 times. Now that the rice is ready, add it to a saucepan along with the whole milk and vanilla, and cook it until the mixture starts to turn thick and creamy. Once it's done, turn off the heat and mix in the coconut milk and jaggery, then season the pudding with the lime zest, salt, cardamom and cinnamon to give it a warm, spiced flavor.

Once the dough is ready, it's time to fill it into 8 (1-oz [30-ml]) spherical molds. If you don't have 8 molds you can bake in batches. Fill them about halfway, then let them proof at room temperature for 15 minutes, until the dough has risen to just below the surface of the mold. Pop them in the oven for 15 minutes, until golden brown. After baking, allow them to cool and demold; you may notice some excess on the top of each sphere, which can be trimmed with a small knife to get a beautiful, rounded shape.",

Finally, sprinkle pistachio powder and rose petals to finish the look."
